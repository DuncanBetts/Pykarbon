Pykarbon Module
===============

**What is it?**

The Pykarbon module provides a set of tools for interfacing with the hardware devices on
Logic Supply's 'Karbon' series industrial PCs. These interfaces include the onboard CAN bus,
Digital IO, and a few other hardware devices.

The goal of this package is to provide a simple, but powerful, base platform for that will allow
users to quickly and easily integrate a Karbon into their own application.

*NOTE: The tools in this package are designed to work with specific hardware;
this will not work for more generalized projects*
