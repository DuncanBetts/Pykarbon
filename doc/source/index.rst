====================
The Pykarbon Project
====================

The Pykarbon module provides a set of tools for interfacing with hardware devices on
Logic Supply's 'Karbon' series industrial PCs. These interfaces include the onboard CAN bus,
Digital IO, and a few other hardware devices. Basically, there's a whole host of reasons that your
project might benefit from leveraging Pykarbon:

- You can start testing and developing right out of the box -- setting up a K300 with Pykarbon and sending some test messages over CAN takes minutes, not hours.
- High level interface offers powerful tools that can be immediately applied to a broad variety of problems.
- Low level hardware access layer gives developers granular control when they need it.
- Humane hardware controls keeps modifying registers or following cryptic instruction manuals at bay. Pykarbon is simple and obvious to use.
- Free and open; anyone is welcome to download, modify, and use the Pykarbon source code however they need or want.


The ultimate goal of this package is to provide a simple, but powerful, base platform that will allow
you to quickly and easily integrate a Karbon into your own application.
